# caloriescalc

Calories calc for every day.

Written with python, visualized on python-tkinter.

This project was made for personal using. Due to having some problems with weight, I decided to make a calories calc, which calculates necessary calories for me to eat. I calculated online amount of calories, which I need to get a good weight per 60 days and 90 days.
I wrote a dict with a few food types, which I'm eating during the day. Also there are two constants set 'amount of calo I need to eat for 60days result' and 'amount of calo I need to eat for 90days result'. Every day I'm entering the food that I ate this day and getting outcome.


## how to use


console version: * *python [directory of project]/main.py* *

This command will show you the dict of food in console. After you have to input which food you ate this day (splitted with spaces). Press ENTER and the programm will give you the outcome.

version with GUI: * *python [directory of project]/GUItkinter.py* *

This command will start tkinter app. There are 2 tabs 'FAQ' and 'Калькулятор'. FAQ is made for instructions of using app (but I didn't fill it yet). You have to click on 'Калькулятор' tab -> click on 'Начать высчитывание калорий'. In the new window u can add a new type of food by clicking 'Добавить продукт' (It won't save for a next run). And of course u can make calculations, you just have to write food that you ate this day in the field and click on 'Выполнить вычисления' button. You will see the result in the first window.

**(Constants can be changed in the program code)**
